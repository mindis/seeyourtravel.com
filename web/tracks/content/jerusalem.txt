*Jerusalem of Gold*<br/>
<br/>
The mountain air is clear as wine<br/>
And the scent of pines<br/>
Is carried on the breeze of twilight<br/>
With the sound of bells.<br/>
<br/>
And in the slumber of tree and stone<br/>
Captured in her dream<br/>
The city that sits solitary<br/>
And in its midst is a wall.<br/>
<br/>
Jerusalem of gold,<br/>
and of bronze, and of light<br/>
Behold I am a violin<br/>
for all your songs.<br/>
<br/>
We have returned to the cisterns<br/>
To the market and to the market-place<br/>
A ram's horn (shofar) calls out<br/>
(i.e. is being heard) on the Temple Mount<br/>
In the Old City.<br/>
<br/>
And in the caves in the mountain<br/>
Thousands of suns shine -<br/>
We will once again descend to the Dead Sea<br/>
By way of Jericho!<br/>
<br/>
Jerusalem of gold,<br/>
and of bronze and of light<br/>
Behold I am a violin for all your songs.<br/>
<br/>
But as I come to sing to you today,<br/>
And to adorn crowns to you (i.e. to tell your praise)<br/>
I am the smallest of the youngest<br/>
of your children (i.e. the least worthy of doing so)<br/>
And of the last poet (i.e. of all the poets born).<br/>
<br/>
For your name scorches the lips<br/>
Like the kiss of a seraph<br/>
If I forget thee, Jerusalem,<br/>
Which is all gold...<br/>
<br/>
Jerusalem of gold, and of bronze, and of light<br/>
Behold I am a violin for all your songs.<br/>
<br/>
